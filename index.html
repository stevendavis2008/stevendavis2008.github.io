  <h2>Bio</h2>
   <p>I come from a back ground of programming CNC machines. I absolutely love programming them.
      Once I started getting a taste of software programming, I realized that I like it more than I would have ever thought.
      So, I am on my journey to becoming a software developer. </p>
